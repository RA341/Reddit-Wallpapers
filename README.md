# Why
I love the wallpapers shared on the [r/wallpaper](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpaper/) and [r/wallpapers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallpapers/), so I created this script to automate downloading process.

* Save the post on reddit.
* Run the script.
* PROFIT !!
* The script will automatically download the images to a folder of your choice.

# Pre-Requisite
* Windows 10
* [Python installation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-install-python-in-windows), [added to windows path](https://datatofish.com/add-python-to-windows-path/)


# Installation
* Download - [install.ps1](https://github.com/RA341/reddit-image-downloader/releases/download/v1.0.0/install.ps1)
* run script with powershell


# Usage

## Notice
* You need to be logged in to reddit on your default browser.
* If you are not logged in the script wont be able to get the details it needs.
* This is a known bug.

In your preferences folder add your preferred subreddits in ```subreddit.txt```.

run script using ```python (path to file)/main.py```.

Optionally-you can add main.py to a task schedule that will run automatically.
